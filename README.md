# Skin Packer for Minecraft Education Edition

This form was developed so that those who use Minecraft's Education Edition (who may have not used Mojang's online store) could easily compile the respective JSON files and information without worrying too much about the code, and UUIDs and all the other complicated stuff.

## Features

This is a form where a user inputs the respective details for their skin file, uploads their custom skin PNG file and the MCPack is generated for them.In version two, users can now add multiple skins to their MCPack.Now in v2, users can see in realtime how their skin will look in the game.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
